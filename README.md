# Annoying-PCB
Have you ever wanted to prank your friends or family in a fun and light-hearted way? Well, just plant one of these in the room and check on them in a few hours! The programmer pins allow you to program the ATTiny85 with code that lets the buzzer beep every 30-40 minutes or whichever duration you wish. I bought a few extra of this from a project course and wanted to make a board to accomadate the buzzer's large size while being as small as possible. 

This project uses an ATTiny85, a low-cost 8-bit microcontroller by Microchip and has a programming header to load code into it via ISP'ing. I used KiCad 8.0 to design this PCB and please fee free to download the attached Gerber files above. Note, please be responsible as this is meant to be used as a joke amongst people you know.
